# Setting up your Desktop Wallet

Once you are done with the installation of your Desktop Wallet on your computer, you can start initializing it.

After installation, the Desktop Wallet will take some time to sync the Blockchain of Skycoin up until the latest block.

The progress of the syncing process will be displayed on the home screen of the Desktop Wallet.

## Wallet Creation

Once the syncing is complete, you can begin the initialization by creating a new Wallet:

**Step 1** - Click on the button **Add Wallet**.

**Step 2** - A dialogue box will appear with the following details :

* A blank box to enter the name of the Wallet - any name you wish to give your Wallet.

* Seed of the Wallet - The Seed is the key component of a Wallet; hence it should be kept in a safe place to secure it from unauthorized access.  
The recommended way to store your Seed is by writing down the Seed in a piece of paper and storing it safely.  
By default, a 12 word Seed will be generated. However, you can opt for a 24 word Seed by click on the button **24 words**.  
You can read more on the security precautions when handling Seed in this chapter - [Securing and Accessing your Seed]().

* The **Confirm Seed** button to confirm the generated Seed, when you click on the "Confirm Seed", you will be asked to enter each words in the Seed, sequentially.  
This is done to ensure that you have safely stored the correct Seed.

**Step 3** - Once you are done entering all the details, you can proceed to create the Desktop Wallet by clicking on the **Create** button.
