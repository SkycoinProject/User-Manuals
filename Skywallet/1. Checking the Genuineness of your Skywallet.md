# Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet

**Congratulations on owning a Skywallet, you are one step closer in ensuring the secure storage of your Skycoins.**

## Checking your Skywallet Package for Tampering

On receiving your Skywallet shipment, please check for any physical tampering or damage to the package of any sort.

Tampering or damage can be anything from a small tear on the package to a package that is torn open.

**Do not accept a shipment which seems to be damaged in any such way.**

### An Untampered Shipment:

Please ensure that the holographic sticker with the Skycoin logo on the Skywallet box is not broken.

## Checking the Firmware

The Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user.

However, it is vital to check that your Skywallet is not compromised before using it.

## Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet

First, connect the Skywallet to your USB port.

## Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display

The display on your Skywallet shows one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Skywallet.

### Scenario 1:

If the Skywallet is a genuine one and is being used for the first time, then the screen will display the following message:

**Welcome!**

**Please visit skycoin.com** 

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

![Welcome_Message](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Pictures/Skywallet_Welcome_Message.png)

A Skywallet that is being used for the first time will not have a firmware installed.

The firmware is the software interface that helps the hardware to interact with both the user as well as a computer. Thus without firmware, your Skywallet will not work correctly.

Any message apart from this welcome message implies that your Skywallet has been tampered with by a third party. Thus if you get any message apart from the welcome message, proceed to disconnect the device and contact support immediately.

### Scenario 2:

A previously used Skywallet may have a firmware initialized, and if it has, then it might mean that it has been manipulated. Such a Skywallet will display the following message on its display screen:

**Needs Seed!**

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

![Needs_Seed](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Pictures/Skywallet_Needs_Seed.png)

If you get a "Needs Seed!" message on your first use, it means that your Skywallet is not a new one and has a firmware already installed.

**Note - If you do get a Needs Seed! message on your first use of the Skywallet, refrain from using the device.**

For further assistance, **Please contact the support team immediately.**

### Scenario 3:

The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

**Unofficial Firmware Detected**

If you are getting the above message, it denotes that the Skywallet is running on a firmware that is not approved by Skycoin. 

Do **not** use a Skywallet displaying such a warning as the software version on your Skywallet might be corrupted, and it is ***unsafe*** to use the Skywallet, as using the said Skywallet could potentially make you lose your coins.
