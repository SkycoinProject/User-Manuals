# Initialization of your Mobile Wallet

Once you are done with the installation of your Mobile Wallet, you can start initializing it.

After installation, the Wallet will take some time to sync with the Blockchain of Skycoin up until the latest block.

Once completed you will be asked to create a PIN code for the Wallet. 

The PIN code is meant to protect your coins from any unauthorized access and hence it is wise to create a PIN which is easy to remember but at the same time hard to guess for a third party.

You can learn more on how to create a safe PIN code in the following chapter:[Security Recommendation for your Mobile Wallet](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Mobile_Wallet/%5BMobile%5D%20Security%20Recommendations.md)

## Wallet Creation

Once you have created the PIN, you can begin the initialization by creating a new Wallet:

**Step 1** - Click on the button **New Wallet**.

**Step 2** - A dialogue box will appear with the following details :

* A blank box to enter the name of the Wallet - any name you wish to give your Wallet.

* Seed of the Wallet - The Seed is the key component of a Wallet; hence it should be kept in a safe place to secure it from unauthorized access.  
The recommended way to store your Seed is by writing down the Seed in a piece of paper and storing it safely.  
You can read more on the security precautions when handling Seed in this chapter - [Security Recommendation for your Mobile Wallet](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Mobile_Wallet/%5BMobile%5D%20Security%20Recommendations.md).

* A blank box to confirm the Seed of the Wallet - The Seed generated needs to be entered in this box to confirm the action.  
You can also generate a new Seed by clicking on the button **NEW SEED**.

**Step 3** - Once you have entered all the details, you can proceed to create the Wallet by clicking on the **Create** button.

Once you are done with the creation of your Wallet, you can use it to send and receive coins.  
You can find the address of your Wallet by clicking on the Wallet, which will display all the addresses under that Wallet.  
In this window, only partial addresses are visible, you can click on the particular address to display the whole address and its QR code.

## Multiple Wallet and Address Creations

Your Mobile Wallet supports the creation of multiple Wallets and addresses.

To create a new Wallet, you can click on the "New Wallet" button and follow the same steps as in the creation of your first Wallet.

To add new addresses to your existing Wallet, you can click on a particular Wallet, and in the resulting window you can click on the **New Address** button.

A new address will be created below your existing addresses.
